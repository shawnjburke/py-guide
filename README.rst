FNG's Guide to Python
=====================

Not bad Python, not bad
------------------------
I learned to code in a Windows world.  Perhaps that makes me old.  Regardless, I grew up with camelCase and PascalCase
in my code as is traditional Microsoft (M$ as many would put it).  There was a time when you never would have convinced
me I would come to prefer snake_case as is common to Python.  I have.  In fact I'm quite enamored with you Python. You
are quick with the script, or agile with the program structure.  You take pride in what makes a professional coder,
appreciation for commenting, code read-ability, and syntactical grace

.. code-block::python
    (name_parameters="are cool", use_them="yes", love_them="yes", defaulting_is_powerful=True)

I guess that makes this my ode to Python.


Purpose of this Project
------------------------
This project is intended to be an end-to-end guide on getting started with Python.  It's intended to establish a best
practice structure that can be used as a beginning state for a python project.  Stepping through all the steps
should be to setup a new Python project, using a set of best practices and coding standards, which can apply across all
types of Python projects.

In the docs/ folder the steps are organized as follows.

* Step 1 - `Install Python`_
* Step 2 - `Install PyCharm`_
* Step 3 - `Python Project Structure`_
* Step 4 - `Python Documentation`_

..  _Install Python: /python_best_practices/install_python.html
..  _Install Pycharm: /python_best_practices/install_Pycharm.html
..  _Python Project Structure: /python_best_practices/project_structure.html
..  _Python Documentation: /python_best_practices/project_documentation_matters.html

What makes this different from other frameworks?
------------------------------------------------
It's my opinion.
It attempts to not be specific to a type of project.  Web projects or console apps can benefit from this.
It doesn't attempt to be an encompassing framework.  Just a starting point.
This is not a web framework like django.
There is not team behind this.  Just me.
