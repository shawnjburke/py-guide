Headings Cheat Sheet
=======================

Here are the different types of heading taken from the Sphinx documentation
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html?highlight=heading

..  topic::
    from the Sphinx documentation

    Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the
    succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting
    which you may follow:

    * # with overline, for parts (hash)
    * \* with overline, for chapters (asterisk)
    * = for sections (equal sign)
    * \- for subsections (dash)
    * ^ for subsubsections (carrot)
    * " for paragraphs (double quote)

When I read that I expected to be able to put all those on one page, and merrily went about my way doing so.  When I
did it created a runtime error.  Or at least I thought.  However, as I wrote this page, I found all playing together;
ah the joys of development.  Disirregardlessly [#foot-note-01]_ [, they play together as described below.
Make sure to look at things like the page Table of Contents which are impacted by these hierarchies.
