Step 2: Install PyCharm
================================

Python code can be written with any text editor.  There are so many editors I won't even try to list them.
Instead I'll say that I have become a *huge fan* of `JetBrain's PyCharm`_.  As you get started they are
cool enough to provide a no cost `Community Edition of Pycharm`_. At very least I suggest you `download it now`_.

As you build your repertoire consider `buying a license`_.  As an individual you can drop a mere $90 and get
yearly license.  If you work for a company encourage them to buy.  The additional productivity is worth the
cost for your company.

There's quite a bit of documentation on how to install Pycharm.  I won't recreate the wheel.  Go Bing it.

Take a breath.  I was purposely fn' with you.  Go Google it.  You'll find items like the `JetBrains Official
Installation Guide`_.
