<p>I learned to code in a Windows world.  Perhaps that makes me old.  Regardless, I grew up with camelCase and PascalCase
in my code as is traditional Microsoft (M$ as many would put it).  There was a time when you never would have convinced
me I would come to prefer snake_case as is common to Python.  I have.  In fact I’m quite enamored with you Python. You
are quick with the script, or agile with the program structure.  You take pride in what makes a professional coder,
appreciation for commenting, code read-ability, and syntactical grace</p>
<p>I guess that makes this my ode to Python.</p>

<h3>Purpose of this Project<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-of-this-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This project is intended to be an end-to-end guide on getting started with Python.  It’s intended to establish a best
practice structure that can be used as a beginning state for a python project.  Stepping through all the steps
should be to setup a new Python project, using a set of best practices and coding standards, which can apply across all
types of Python projects.</p>
<p>The docs are hosted with gitHub Pages, with html in the docs/ folder, powered by reStructured text markup in the
data-source folder.  You can get to the root at <a class="reference external" href="https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/">https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/</a>.</p>
<p>Best practice steps are organized as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Step 1 - <a class="reference external" href="https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/python_best_practices/install_python.html">Install Python</a></li>
<li>Step 2 - <a class="reference external" href="https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/python_best_practices/install_Pycharm.html">Install PyCharm</a></li>
<li>Step 3 - <a class="reference external" href="https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/python_best_practices/project_structure.html">Python Project Structure</a></li>
<li>Step 4 - <a class="reference external" href="https://shawnjburke.github.io/py-guide/python_best_practices/project_documentation_matters.html">Python Documentation</a></li>

<h3>What makes this different from other frameworks?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-makes-this-different-from-other-frameworks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s my opinion.
It attempts to not be specific to a type of project.  Web projects or console apps can benefit from this.
It doesn’t attempt to be an encompassing framework.  Just a starting point.
This is not a web framework like django.
There is not team behind this.  Just me.</p>
