There's no shame in Windows
---------------------------
I get that all the cool kids use a MAC these days.  However I'm old.  In the early days I needed a platform with a
interface, where I could think for myself on my own hardware, and that was Windows.  This guide will point out things
specific to windows as all the others focus on Linux.  Linux is cool.  I'm running it in my Amazon cloud too. Checking
out their latest UI distros with ElementaryOS. Nothing but respect; just not using every day in my windows based
consulting.

Death to the damn MAC square keys that ruined keyboards.
