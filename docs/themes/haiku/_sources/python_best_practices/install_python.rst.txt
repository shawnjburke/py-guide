Install Python
================

Thie guide will recommend that you install Python 3.x and work with it.  There's an older version,
Python 2.7, which is still in wide use.  In my opinion there's a lot of 2.7 python dedication just
because so much code exists to that version.  For instance I have a client where 2.7 is used because
it's on the servers to support a long succssful appllication in Python.  If you can, though, go
with the latest and greatest and start with Python 3.x

    The above list is created, in the source text, using a new line for each bullet, beginning with an * (asterisk).
    In the source there is a blank line between the title, Install Python 3.x, and that is required to create this
    bullet list.

    Look at the bottom of the page for a link that will allow you to see this page's, or any page's, markup source.

There's a lot of documentation already in existence about installing Python.  I'm not going to recreate more here.
Go Bing it.
