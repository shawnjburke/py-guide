        encapsulated the Python standard logging into my logging_trees project.  By default this class can
        create the logging file and add the handler to direct logs to it.  The file logger will be set to write
        all logs to the file.  In addition we the logger will take Info level logs and above, and also write them to
        stdout so that it can be used instead of print statements."""
