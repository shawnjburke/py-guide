Welcome to Python Guide's docs!

Overview
#############

Python Guide is one humble [#f1]_ tech warriors opinions on the best way to get going with Python.  In addition, this
guide tries to highlight anything specific to Python and Windows, as python does are often linux leaning.

The guide is setup to provide a best practice of how to develop in Python.   Really it reflects development practices
I believe are good in any language and are implemented here with Python.  Things such as writing documentation are
included.  Recognizing these are subjects not always popular with programmers, they are popular with guys like me
who have to lead companies and need to be able to do crazy things, like maintain code years (if not decades) after it
was written.  Documentation is good; at very least necessary.  This guild will make things like that straight forward
to setup where possible.
