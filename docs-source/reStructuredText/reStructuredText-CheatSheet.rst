reStructuredText Cheat Sheet
=============================

reStructuredText is a markup language for documentation.  This markup is processed by the Sphinx engine to create
an output.  HTML is one type of output.  What makes this combination powerful is you can create PDF output with the same
source material, written in restructured text [#foot-note-1]_.

.. [#foot-note-1] I was not influenced by being on github to be a markdown fan.  When I choose to use reStructuredText
    I did so with a few thoughts, from research, it was more flexible.  However I can't really claim that's a good
    reason to use reStructuredText over markdown.  A good read, if be it a biased opinion, can be found at
    http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/, but it's biased and a few years
    old at this point.
